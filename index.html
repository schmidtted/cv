		<h2>Who I am</h2>
		<p>I was born in the USA but have made New Zealand my home. I am a dual citizen and have lived and worked in New
			Zealand since 2004. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Graphics, a Masters Certificate in Information
			and
			Telecommunication Systems, and a Masters of Business Administration.</p>
		<p>I started my professional life as a US Naval Officer and served on several surface ships and have even spent
			a
			number of months on a submarine. Following my service in the Navy, I embarked on a career in IT with a focus
			on
			web application development; initially as a developer and progressing through to roles with aspects of
			account
			management, product management, business analysis, project management, leadership, and general management.
		</p>
		<p>What gets me up in the morning is a company with solid values, a clear mission with a noble purpose, and a
			coherent strategy. I believe a great company is one that sees the unique talents of its employees and
			leverages
			them in a way that makes people feel fulfilled and able to do their best work.</p>
		<p>No matter what company, position, project, or task I am involved with I always approach the situation with a
			curious mind and enjoy working on finding solutions to problems with others. Relationships are at the heart
			of
			everything I do and the lens through which I view the world.</p>
